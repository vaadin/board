The final result of this tutorial can be explored at link:https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-board-getting-started[GitHub].

[[board.project.setup]]
== Project Setup

Follow the link:https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#install[instructions] to install Polymer CLI.
Create an app project following these link:https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#app[instructions].
Select [classname]#polymer-2-application# as a template when running [command]#polymer init#.
After the initialization process Polymer CLI generates the following files and directories.

* bower.json. Configuration file for Bower.
* bower_components/. Project dependencies. See Manage dependencies.
* index.html. Entrypoint page of the app.
* src/my-app/my-app.html. Source code for main element.
* test/my-app/my-app_test.html. Tests for main element.

== Add Vaadin Board Dependency

You can use http://bower.io[Bower] to install Vaadin Board dependency by running the following command inside your project folder:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#bower# install --save vaadin-board
----
This will install the latest available version of Vaadin Board.

Add html import to your html element (src/my-app/my-app.html):

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/vaadin-board/vaadin-board.html">
</head>
</html>
----
[[board.project.setup.installing.license]]
== Installing a License Key
You need to install a license key in order to develop your application with Vaadin Board web component.

You can purchase Vaadin Board or obtain a free trial key from the link:https://vaadin.com/pro/licenses[Vaadin Licenses page].
You need to register in the Vaadin website to obtain the key.

When you first time open the web page with Vaadin Board, you will see a pop-up that asks you to enter the license key.
If the license is valid, it will be saved to the local storage of the browser and you will not see the pop-up again.

[[board.project.setup.configuration]]
== Basic Configuration

[classname]#vaadin-board# is divided into rows, using [classname]#vaadin-board-row#.
Rows are divided into columns.
You can put any WebComponent or HTML element inside the [classname]#vaadin-board-row#.
Every element inside the row can take from one to four columns.
Vaadin Board rearranges child elements based on available space.
In the example below every child [elementname]#div# will use 25% on Desktop, but will be
rearranged to two rows when switching to tablet: one row with 2 items 50% of available space each and second row
with 100% width item. Insert the following code in you html element, inside [elementname]#template# tag:

[source, html]
----
    <vaadin-board>
      <vaadin-board-row>
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>
        <div class="item">4</div>
      </vaadin-board-row>
      <vaadin-board-row>
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
      </vaadin-board-row>
    </vaadin-board>
----

Then we can add styling to our content. Insert the following CSS , inside [elementname]#style# tag:

[source, html]
----
.item {
    display: block;
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-right: 0;
    font-weight: bold;
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 3px;
    border-color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #cacaca;
    height:100px;
}
----

Run [command]#polymer serve --open# to see the following result:

Vaadin Board rearranges child elements based on viewport size.
You can change the size of the Web browser window to see how your application will look on different devices.
