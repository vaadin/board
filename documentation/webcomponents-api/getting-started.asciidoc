[[board.getting-started]]
= Getting started with Vaadin Board

[classname]`vaadin-board` is a regular https://www.webcomponents.org/[web component], which you can add to any web page. It can be used both with and without https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/about_20[Polymer 2].

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. <<Create a Polymer application>>
2. <<Add the Vaadin Board dependency>>
3. <<Install your license key>>
4. <<Add the Vaadin Board component to your web page>>

In this tutorial we will use https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli[Polymer CLI] for creating the initial project. At the end of the tutorial, you should end up with the same code as found at https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-board-getting-started[GitHub].

[[board.project.setup]]
== Create a Polymer application

1. https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#install[Install Polymer CLI].
2. On the same page, follow the instructions to "Set up basic app project", but when Polymer CLI asks [prompt]`Which starter template would you like to use?` (step 3), select `polymer-2-application`.

After the initialization process, Polymer CLI generates the following files and directories:

`bower.json`:: Configuration file for Bower.
`bower_components/`:: Project dependencies. See Manage dependencies.
`index.html`:: Entrypoint page of the app.
`src/my-app/my-app.html`:: Source code for main element.
`test/my-app/my-app_test.html`:: Tests for main element.

Use [command]`polymer serve --open` to run the Polymer application.

[[board.project.setup.dependency]]
== Add the Vaadin Board dependency

You can use http://bower.io[Bower] to install Vaadin Board dependency by running the following command inside your project folder:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#bower# install --save vaadin-board
----

This will install the latest available version of Vaadin Board.

You can then import Vaadin Board inside your HTML element (in `src/my-app/my-app.html`):

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="import" href="../../bower_components/vaadin-board/vaadin-board.html">
</head>
</html>
----

[[board.project.setup.installing.license]]
== Install your license key

You need to install a license key in order to develop your application with the Vaadin Board web component.

You can purchase a subscription or obtain a free trial key from the https://vaadin.com/pro/licenses[Vaadin Licenses page].
You need to register in the Vaadin website to obtain the key.

When you first time open your web page with Vaadin Board, you will see a pop-up that asks you to enter the license key.
If the license is valid, it will be saved to the local storage of the browser and you will not see the pop-up again.

[[board.project.setup.configuration]]
== Add the Vaadin Board component to your web page

[classname]`vaadin-board` is divided into rows, using [classname]`vaadin-board-row`.
Rows are divided into columns.
You can put any WebComponent or HTML element inside the [classname]`vaadin-board-row`.
Every element inside the row can take from one to four columns.
Vaadin Board rearranges child elements based on available space.

In the example below every child [elementname]`div` will use 25% on Desktop, but will be
rearranged to two rows when switching to tablet: one row with 2 items 50% of available space each and second row
with 100% width item.

Insert the following code in your HTML element (again, in `src/my-app/my-app.html`), inside [elementname]`template` tag:

[source, html]
----
    <vaadin-board>
      <vaadin-board-row>
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>
        <div class="item">4</div>
      </vaadin-board-row>
      <vaadin-board-row>
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
      </vaadin-board-row>
    </vaadin-board>
----

Then we can add styling to our content. Insert the following CSS , inside the [elementname]`style` tag:

[source, html]
----
.item {
    display: block;
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-right: 0;
    font-weight: bold;
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 3px;
    border-color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #cacaca;
    height:100px;
}
----

Run [command]`polymer serve --open` to see the following result:

[[figure.board.getting.started.configuration]]
.Vaadin Board Basic Configuration

Vaadin Board rearranges child elements based on viewport size.
You can change the size of the Web browser window to see how your application will look on different devices.

Congratulations! You have your first Vaadin Board setup.
